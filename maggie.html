      <h3>Skills: stealth, lethal pounce, healing purr</h3>
      <p>This little kitty went to market and murdered all the rats in a five mile radius. If you’re looking for an assassin to protect your goods and storehouses then look no further than Maggie. Don’t let her small stature fool you. This little girl is murder machine.</p>
      <p>On silent silky paws, Miss Maggie will relentlessly stalk her prey until she engages her lethal strike maneuvers, landing on her target and terminating the threat to your business. She works primarily at night using the darkness as her cloak and adding to her ferocious reputation as the best mouser in the business. She doesn’t limit herself to rodents. Maggie has also been successful in taking down waterbugs, roaches, beetles, flying insects, and running off enemy cats twice her size.</p>
      <p>During the day, Maggie also serves as a loyal companion and healer. Her enormous purr has been able to comfort the most lonely humans and we have anecdotal evidence of her ability to heal broken hearts.</p>
      <p>Maggie is available year round for pest control or companionship with each tour of duty lasting 3 - 5 months at a time. Additional fees apply for longer engagements.</p>
