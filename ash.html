      <h3>Skills: hyper focus, dedication to the job, P.A.W. targeting expert</h3>
      <p>Always late for class? Need to get an early flight? Canâ€™t avoid hitting the snooze button? Ashfur is your cat. With his proactive and can do cattitude, Ash will make sure that you get out of bed and get on with your day, after a routine feeding of course, with our patented Persistent Annoying and Whimsical (P.A.W.) targeting techniques, specially designed for rousting even the most sleep deprived humans.</p>
      	<ul>
	      <li><strong>P</strong>ersistance: He will Persistently engage in vocalization to alert the human that it is time to get up (comes in three different sounds: loud, louder, loudest). </li>
	      <li><strong>A</strong>nnoying: If more severe measures are needed, Ash will continue with Annoying the sleeper by using strategically targeted pokes in vulnerable human pressure points, among them: eyes, mouth, and butt if needed.</li>
	      <li><strong>W</strong>himsical: Ash will also employ a variety of Whimsical diagnostics to keep his human guessing as to what way they will be awakened. Some methods include, but are not limited to, knocking over items on your nightstand, breaking something in the other room, and turning off your CPAP breathing apparatus if applicable. </li>
  		</ul>
      <p>Ash is available for Alarm Clock duty during the school calendar year starting in September and ending in May, excluding major holidays and weekends. </p>
