      <h3>Skills: agility, comedic timing, obnoxious cuddling</h3>
      <p>Look no further for for a snuggly kitty and entertaining clown than Sammie the court jester. He’ll have you wowed with his amazing aerial acrobatics, back flips, and lightening speed as he chases down whatever toy or laser you have to offer. With his almost limitless energy, Sammie will bring you his toys to purrrform for you and make you smile. Even mealtimes are fun when Sammie is with you. At any time, Sammie will pull your spoon or fork near his face to see what treats his favorite human is having. Ice cream is his favorite. </p>
      <p>His charm knows no boundaries. No seriously, he has no boundaries. Reading in bed? His size won’t stop him from pushing his way onto your chest and curling up with a loud purr session. On the toilet? He will serenade you with the song of his people so you won’t get bored. Sleeping? Not alone! Sammie will curl up with you for a long snooze, executing the perfect blep for your instagram feed.</p>
      <p>Sammie is available during the summer months, spring break, and major holidays. He’s best suited for children 8 - 13, teens, and lonely young adults looking for an active and high spirited friend. </p>
