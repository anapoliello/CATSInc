      <h3>Skills: high charisma, compact travel size, eager to learn new skills</h3>
      <p>Our trainees will keep your keyboard warm and your heart warmer when you hire these adorable interns as your companions or tech support. Right now they can catch your computer mouse better than an actual mouse, but these feisty felines are eager to add to their job experience and hopefully a permanent position as your family member.</p>
      <p>The trainees are also adept at minor comic timing, lesser healing purr sessions, and short term bathroom monitoring so you donâ€™t get bored brushing your teeth. We evaluate our trainees twice a year and offer career building support as well as room and board with our administrative staff. </p>
      <p>All of our trainees are available for permanent hire. Please contact us for an application and instructions for on boarding for full time positions. </p>
